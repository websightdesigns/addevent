### Apple Calendar

Apple's Calendar app uses a downloaded .ics file to set up the event in your calendar. 

### Outlook

Microsoft's Outlook app also uses a downloaded .ics file to set up the event in your calendar.

### Google Calendar



### Yahoo! Calendar

Yahoo Calendar is the only calendar API that requires an event duration. With Yahoo! Calendar, you provide the event start date/time and it's duration.
